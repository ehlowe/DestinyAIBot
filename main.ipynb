      "4. Concerns about foreign government disinformation campaigns using social media to amplify social/political division and radicalization in the U.S., viewing platforms like TikTok as potential threats.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. Critiquing self-help content that enables harmful behaviors versus challenging people to improve their circumstances, using examples like Dr. K and Jordan Peterson's contrasting approaches.\n",
      "\n",
      "6. Parenting advice on handling children's behavior, meltdowns in public, establishing rules, socializing kids while prioritizing academics, and parent-teacher coordination.\n",
      "\n",
      "Smaller Details:\n",
      "\n",
      "- Definitions of legal concepts like genocide, conspiracy to defraud\n",
      "- References to YouTube drama between various creators\n",
      "- Personal stories about childhood, family, and running businesses\n",
      "- Analyzing wage/earnings data across professions\n",
      "- Tax advice and implications of education levels\n",

       " 'transcript': \"e\\ne\\ne\\ne\\ne\\nwow hi what's\\nup\\nwould you agree with asmin\\ngold\\nso people are pissed off at Dr K so the\\nnumber one thing that correlates with\\nmale suicide is not depression this is\\nsuper scary there's one study I saw\\nrecently that suggests that 50% of men\\nwho kill themselves have no history or\\nevidence of mental illness and this I I\\nbelieve this statistic in in my clinical\\npractice because I know what depression\\nlooks like I know what bipolar disorder\\nlooks like and half the men that I've\\nworked with at least are not actually\\nmentally ill see mental illness means a\\npathology of the mind which means that\\nthe mind is malfunctioning most of the\\nsuicidal men that I work with they're\\nnot ma their mind isn't malfunctioning\\nthey genuinely have a life that is noer\\nworth living they're looking at things\\nand objectively realizing that there's\\nno way out of the situation so they turn\\nto Suicide so I know it's kind of like a\\nvery contral statement but I think\\nthat's what my clinical practice has\\nshown and there's some research to even\\nback that up so the number one so people\\nare mad about this people are pissed off\\nand it's like obviously he's not saying\\nthat they should kill themselves he's\\ntalking about it from their perspective\\nright it's like I haven't seen the\\ncontext but like tell me am I wrong\\nthat's clearly why it's like from their\\nperspective they think that their life\\nisn't going to get any better so like\\nthey logically come to this conclusion\\nrather than come to this conclusion\\nthrough a manifestation of some sort of\\nactual pathology of the mind like he\\nsays but people don't understand that\\nand they're getting pissed off at him\\nright this is crazy why live your life\\nis stupid well why not take a huge risk\\nwhat do you have to lose well that's\\nthat's again what you have to teach\\npeople right and that's clearly what the\\npoint is life's not worth living is\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] intended to Pander to social\\nmedia audience no like bro I feel like\\nthat sometimes right like I remember\\nwhenever I was younger like I thought to\\nmyself I was like damn like whenever I\\nget older my life is just going to suck\\ndick more and more every year like why\\nam I alive right because like if you are\\nlike I don't know like especially under\\n21 things are going up right but like\\nwhenever you get to like I don't know a\\nbit after that you're going to feel like\\noh now things are going down you know\\nnow you're going to have more health\\nproblems now you're going bald your\\nparents are aging you have to get a job\\nlike when's like what's the next good\\nthing that's going to happen to you and\\nit's like if you can't find that you\\ndon't know where that is in your life of\\ncourse you're going to [\\xa0__\\xa0] think\\nthat doesn't mean that you're mentally\\nill it means that you're not you can see\\nwhat's going on in your own [\\xa0__\\xa0] life\\ndoesn't mean you should kill yourself\\nit's not the solution but that's the way\\npeople feel you have to understand it\\nlike if you want a tweet to do really\\nwell on Twitter you have to make the\\nTweet stupid because if the Tweet tries\\nto communicate an idea it won't work\\nbecause people on Twitter are stupid the\\nbest argument is not an argument you\\nhave to make people think something by\\nuh some form of other emotional\\npersuasion and I think that like really\\nwhat this shows is like in my opinion\\nlike this is in a way like actual\\nempathy where you can legitimately see\\nthe way another person feels like you\\nactually try to put yourselves in that\\nperson's shoes and think about how that\\nperson actually feels in the situation\\nrather than just going and being like\\nwell this is what I would do and this is\\nmy viewpoint and so you should do the\\nway that you should do it the way that I\\nthink that it should happen like what\\nthe [\\xa0__\\xa0] are you doing like that's not\\nyou that's not you bro like what is this\\nyeah so corrector yeah and and like I\\nthink that this this post here it goes\\nto show that how little people actually\\nhave empathy they don't really have any\\nempathy they just want to hear their\\nViewpoint repeated and they view people\\nthat uh you know repeat their Viewpoint\\nas empathetic and people who don't as\\nnot so much of the like dialogue and so\\nmuch of the like self-help and [\\xa0__\\xa0] like\\nthis on the Internet is actually in my\\nthis is my opinion is only there to make\\npeople feel good about bad decisions\\nthat they've already made and justify\\nfuture bad decisions it's not actually\\nthere to challenge the individual it's\\nnot there to improve their life it's\\nthere to validate their pre-existing\\nNotions and make them feel like they're\\ndoing the right thing and so we\\nshouldn't it shouldn't justify yeah\\nexactly and so like this is why for\\nexample you have all these people like\\nwhenever I say that you know you should\\nstop uh you know spending all your time\\non the internet playing video games all\\nthe time uh people get mad about this\\nand they say like oh well you know if\\nlike if your job is bad you should work\\ntowards getting a better job people get\\nmad about this why do they get mad about\\nthis it's very simple because people\\ndon't want to hear that what they're\\ndoing is wrong so this the type of like\\nself-help that happens on the Internet\\nis generally actually toxic because all\\nit does in the popular stuff is that it\\njust tells people that the bad thing\\nthat you're doing is actually okay and\\nit's not your fault what is the why am I\\nwatching this I feel like I generally\\ntend to agree with most things that ask\\nsays I feel like I've said like this\\nexact same thing before like the whole\\npoint of a diagnosis is you diagnose the\\nthings so that you can figure out how to\\nfix the thing but when most people go\\nonline to figure out problems with\\nthemselves they find problems with\\nthemselves they can make excuses for\\nwhat they do not to actually change any\\nthe behavior I feel like everybody said\\nall this I don't know why I'm pretty\\nsure pretty sure I would agree with\\nasmin on like most of\\nthis it's like the reason why you spend\\n12 hours a day jerking off to furry porn\\nfor animals that don't exist isn't\\nbecause there's something wrong with you\\nand you need to get a job no it's\\nbecause of capitalism and Donald Trump\\nlike the reason why you can't get a\\ngirlfriend isn't because you have thir\\ndifferent figurines of llies that like\\nyou don't want to shine a black light on\\nthem on that's not the reason why you\\ncan't get a girlfriend it's because of\\nwhole flation and women nowadays only\\nwant to [\\xa0__\\xa0] Chads and the internet is\\nout to get\\nme like and this is the thing right so\\nit's like why is it you just always get\\nto hear the thing that reaffirms what\\nyou're already doing it's whole flation\\nyeah that's right guys and so this is\\nwhat happens right and so like whenever\\nyou have somebody like Dr k who's\\nactually trying to help people who's\\nactually trying to help people and isn't\\nafraid of you know like oh somebody\\nmight take this the wrong way or\\nwhatever treats people like adults you\\nsee the um the programming with people\\nthat have so many different levels of\\nlearned helplessness that are just like\\nhardcoded into them they're just\\nmalfunctioning because they're not\\nhearing the thing that makes them feel\\ngood you're right [\\xa0__\\xa0] NPCs that's\\nright drives me [\\xa0__\\xa0] crazy what he\\nsaid is dangerous yeah and what other\\npeople say is dangerous anything can be\\ndangerous to anyone what's your point\\nyeah Forks are more dangerous again he's\\nspeaking out of empathy yeah actual\\nempathy and that's what I was saying\\nbefore about how so many people don't\\neven have the context to even understand\\nwhat real empathy is and whenever they\\nsee it demonstrated in video form\\nthey're just like they they they they\\nactually can't think of themselves as\\nanother person they can't this is one of\\nthe things that I talk about um when it\\ncomes to people that do the\\num like the Relentless\\nvalidation is people think\\nthat\\n[\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't ever want to give him\\ncredit for anything but\\num I've never actually heard him do a\\nvideo on this I just saw a tweet on this\\npeople think that you can never have too\\nmuch compassion um or people think that\\nuh you know as long as you're validating\\nsomeone at least you're like trying to\\nhelp them but that's not true validating\\nsomebody or over validating somebody I\\nthink comes I don't I want to say comes\\nfrom but it's it's a similar type of\\nthing to like roasting the [\\xa0__\\xa0] out of\\nsomebody or tearing somebody down at the\\nend of the day you're just doing it\\nbecause it makes you feel better you\\nvalidate somebody because it makes you\\nfeel better because you think that\\nyou're helping them even if you're not\\nor you tear somebody down because makes\\nyou feel better even if it's not help\\nthem at all CU whatever maybe they come\\nfrom slightly different places but at\\nthe end of the day they're all self-\\nserving um people that people that over\\nvalidate people because it makes them\\nfeel good it makes them feel like\\nthey're helping but they don't actually\\nhelp somebody get help or do something\\nthey do to prove themselves is really\\nfrustrating I'm curious what he says in\\nthis I've never actually listened to him\\ndo a video on this I saw him he tweeted\\nout some like toxic compassion as the\\nother end of\\ntoxic like Behavior or something but\\nyeah I know Norm thinkle see a sort of a\\nlaughing stock in academic circles but\\nbased on psych people you've talked to\\nis Jordan Peterson respected at all\\nJordan\\nPeterson's here's the thing Jordan\\nPeterson I'm pretty sure was respected\\nbut I don't think he was very\\ncontroversial like I don't think any of\\nthe things that Jordan Peterson said\\nprior to like the c16 [\\xa0__\\xa0] I don't think\\nmany things were very controversial um\\nlike he had a practice where he actually\\nlike helped people and saw you know\\nwomen and help them do better in their\\njobs and blah blah blah so I mean like\\nhe was literally practicing uh clinician\\nthat did psychology but the um but his\\nhis medical takes after c16 and\\neverything are are garbage like so\\nobviously I'm more aware of the areas of\\nlike ADHD like everythin\",\n",
